# Overview

This is a Streamlit web application that generates hypothetical historical battle scenarios. The app allows users to select different historical factions (Roman Legion, Viking Raiders, Mongol Horde, etc.) and generates randomized battle scenarios with terrain descriptions, unit compositions, and tactical narratives. It's designed as an educational and entertainment tool for history enthusiasts and gamers interested in historical warfare simulation.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit Framework**: Single-page web application built with Streamlit for rapid prototyping and deployment
- **Interactive UI**: Uses Streamlit's built-in components for user input (selectboxes, buttons) and output display
- **Real-time Generation**: Immediate battle scenario generation upon user interaction without page refreshes

## Backend Architecture
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Faction class encapsulates faction data including terrain preferences, units, characteristics, and special abilities
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Static dictionaries store terrain rules and faction definitions for easy modification and expansion
- **Randomization Engine**: Uses Python's random module to generate varied battle scenarios from predefined data sets
- **Modular Structure**: Separates data definitions (factions, terrain) from logic (scenario generation)

## Data Storage
- **In-Memory Storage**: All faction and terrain data stored as Python dictionaries and class instances
- **No Persistent Storage**: Stateless application with no database or file-based storage requirements
- **Structured Data Models**: Faction class provides consistent data structure for all historical factions

## Content Generation
- **Template-Based Narratives**: Combines faction characteristics, terrain descriptions, and unit types into coherent battle scenarios
- **Randomized Elements**: Selects random terrain subtypes and battle dynamics for variety
- **Contextual Content**: Generates scenarios that respect historical faction strengths and terrain preferences

# External Dependencies

## Python Packages
- **Streamlit 1.37.1**: Web application framework for the user interface
- **Pandas 2.2.2**: Data manipulation library (imported but not actively used in current implementation)

## Runtime Environment
- **Replit Platform**: Cloud-based development and hosting environment
- **Python Runtime**: Requires Python environment with package management capabilities

## Deployment Configuration
- **Port Configuration**: Configured to run on Replit's dynamic port system using $PORT environment variable
- **Network Binding**: Binds to 0.0.0.0 for external access within Replit's hosting environment
